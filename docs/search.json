The analysis covers several key parameters: capasities, valedictorians, gender distribution, the geographical regions from which students originate, and the number of national preferences for the faculty. By examining these aspects, the project aims to highlight shifts in student demographics, changes in gender representation, regional diversity, and the popularity of the faculty across Turkey. The findings will provide valuable insights into the evolution of admission policies and the factors influencing student choices during this period.\n\n\nData Set\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
